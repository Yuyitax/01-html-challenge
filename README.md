# üèóÔ∏è Implementation of Accessibility Standards

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* AS A marketing agency:
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I view the source code:
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Notes:

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance at 992px or smaller:
