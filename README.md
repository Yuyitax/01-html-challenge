# üèóÔ∏è Implementation of Accessibility Standards

In this first coding challenge, I will demonstrate what I have learned in the first two weeks of the coding bootcamp. 

The challenge was a learning experience were hours of coding happened while troubleshooting my own errors. More specifically, making the page responsive without modifying the original codes and by using the new learned media query rules. 

The page originally had a lot of unnecessary CSS tags that I was able to clean and compressed in order to make it better for the next developer. Every detail about what was done, changed, or replaced can be found inside both the HTML and CSS files.

The website should be fully accessible, and compliant with 508 standard rules. All semantics were carefully thought out in order to make it compliant and visually clean. Small details in the design had to be changed in order to achieve some of these rules. 

Overall, building this page was very fun, stressful, and surprisingly time consuming, but most importantly, it was educative and helped me understand that patience and debugging are two very important virtues in developer. 

## About the Assignment - Acceptance Criteria:

- AS A marketing agency:
  I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

WHEN I view the source code:

- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Visuals:

The following images demonstrate the online webpage, split into the top row (header, navigator and hero image) and two columns, one for the main content on the left showcasing the agency's services and one sidebar on the right listing the benefits.
